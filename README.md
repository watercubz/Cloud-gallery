## üê≥ Setup Guide for Running **Cloud Gallery** with Docker

Follow these steps to set up and run Cloud Gallery using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
  - [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-gallery.git
cd cloud-gallery
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Create an .env file in the project root if one doesn‚Äôt already exist.
Add necessary environment variables for Cloud Gallery, such as database credentials, API keys, and any other required configuration.
Example .env file:

  ```env
   VITE_PUBLIC_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name_here"  # e.g., "my_cloud"
   VITE_SECRET_API_KEY="7374ee773ufyye3:2372372737273ee2372"  # API Key and Secret
   VITE_CLOUDINARY_FOLDER="your_folder_here"       # e.g., "uploads"
   VITE_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API="your_gemini-api-key"    # e.g., "eru4uwu4422ueeesd32frt5434eerr"
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"           # e.g., "https://supa.xdrovbk.co"
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"
   ```
# Add any other necessary variables here

## Step 3: Build the Docker Images
Build the Docker images using Docker Compose:

```
docker build -t atxpaul/react.app
```
This command will create the necessary Docker images for the application and its dependencies (e.g., database, web server).

## Step 4: Run the Containers
Start the containers with Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up
```

This command will launch all the necessary containers.
The app should now be accessible at http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified in your Docker configuration).

## Step 5: Verify the Setup
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173.

Verify that the application is running correctly.

Check the logs for any errors by running:

```
docker-compose logs -f
```
## Additional Commands
Stop the Containers: To stop the running containers, use:
```
docker-compose down
```
Rebuild the Containers: If you make changes to the Docker configuration or code, rebuild the images:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
